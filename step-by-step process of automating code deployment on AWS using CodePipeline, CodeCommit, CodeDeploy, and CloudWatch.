**Step 1: Setting up AWS CodeCommit:**
1. Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeCommit service
   - Click on "Create repository" and provide a name for your repository (e.g., "MyApp").
   - Choose the repository settings, such as repository description, and click "Create repository."

2. Clone the Repository Locally and Add Application Code:
   - Clone the CodeCommit repository to your local machine using the HTTPS or SSH URL provided in the repository's settings.
   - Add your application code and any required files to the local repository.
   - Commit the changes locally.

3. Push Changes to the CodeCommit Repository:
   - Push the committed changes from your local repository to the CodeCommit repository using the "git push" command.

**Step 2: Installing AWS CLI and CodeDeploy Agent on EC2:**
1. Launch an EC2 Instance and Create IAM Role:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
   - Launch an Amazon EC2 instance, selecting the Amazon Linux AMI or another supported operating system.
   - Create a new IAM role or use an existing one with permissions to access CodeDeploy.

2. Connect to the EC2 Instance using SSH:
   - Use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance using the private key (.pem) associated with the key pair used during instance creation.

3. Install AWS CLI and CodeDeploy Agent on the EC2 Instance:
   - Run the following commands on the EC2 instance to install the AWS CLI and CodeDeploy agent using user data:
     ```bash
     sudo yum update -y
     sudo yum install -y ruby
     sudo yum install -y aws-cli
     cd /home/ec2-user
     aws configure # Enter your AWS access key, secret key, region, and output format
     aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-{region}/latest/install . --region {region}
     chmod +x ./install
     sudo ./install auto
     ```
   - Replace "{region}" with the AWS region you are using.

**Step 3: Setting up AWS CodeDeploy:**
1. Create an IAM Role for CodeDeploy:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
   - Create a new IAM role named "CodeDeployServiceRole" with the required permissions for CodeDeploy. Attach the "AWSCodeDeployRole" policy.

2. Create an Application in CodeDeploy:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeDeploy service.
   - Click on "Create application" and provide a name for your application (e.g., "MyApp").
   - Choose the compute platform (e.g., EC2/On-Premises).

3. Set Up a Deployment Group for the EC2 Instance:
   - In the CodeDeploy console, click on "Create deployment group."
   - Choose the application you created earlier (e.g., "MyApp").
   - Specify the deployment group name (e.g., "MyDeploymentGroup").
   - Choose the deployment type as "In-place."
   - Under "Environment configuration," select "Amazon EC2 Instances" and provide tags or choose instances based on other criteria.
   - Configure deployment settings such as load balancer (if applicable) and alarms.
   - Click "Create deployment group" to complete the setup.

**Step 4: Configuring AWS CodePipeline:**
1. Open the AWS CodePipeline Console:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodePipeline service.

2. Create a New Pipeline:
   - Click on "Create pipeline" and provide a name for your pipeline (e.g., "MyAppPipeline").

3. Configure the Source Stage:
   - Choose "AWS CodeCommit" as the source provider.
   - Select the repository and branch you want to trigger the pipeline on.
   - Configure any other settings, such as repository polling or webhook triggers.

4. Configure the Build Stage (Optional):
   - If you need to build your application code, choose "AWS CodeBuild" as the build provider.
   - Select the build project or create a new one if required.
   - Configure build settings based on your application's build process.

5. Configure the Deployment Stage:
   - Choose "AWS CodeDeploy" as the deployment provider.
   - Select the application and deployment group you created earlier.
   - Specify the deployment settings, such as deployment settings, file type, and revision location.

**Step 5: Triggering the Pipeline:**
1. Make Changes to Your Application Code:
   - Make code changes in your local repository and commit them.
   - Push the changes to the specified branch in the CodeCommit repository.

2. Observe the Pipeline Execution:
   - Go to the AWS CodePipeline console and monitor the pipeline's execution.
   - The pipeline will automatically detect the changes in the CodeCommit repository and trigger the build and deployment stages.

**Step 6: Monitor Deployment with AWS CloudWatch:**
1. Use AWS CloudWatch to Monitor the Pipeline:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.
   - Use CloudWatch to monitor the pipeline's execution, view logs, and set up alarms for critical events.

2. Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Notifications:
   - Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor the health of the EC2 instances and trigger notifications for critical events.

**Conclusion:**
By following this comprehensive step-by-step process, you have successfully automated code deployment on AWS using CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, and CloudWatch. Your application code changes will now
